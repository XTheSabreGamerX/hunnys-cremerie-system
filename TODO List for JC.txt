TODO ADVISER:
- INCREASE MARGIN FOR TABLE IN INVENTORY
- ADD EXPIRATION TO CATEGORY MODEL
- MAKE STOCK IN INVENTORY REQUIRED
- CHANGE INVENTORY AMOUNT TO QUANTITY
- EDIT INVENTORY: IF CHANGING QUANITITY LOWER THAN ORIGINAL, DELETE ORIGINAL ENTRY AND POST NEW ENTRY
- "I WANT TO DIVIDE 750 INTO 3", THEN STOCK AMOUNT CHANGES ACCORDINGLY
- SPLIT INPUTS OF AMOUNT TO INDICATE SEPARATE REPACK AMOUNTS, THEN CHECKS IF IT EXCEEDS ORIGINAL
- ADD INVENTORY MODEL FIELD ISMODIFIED
- ADD ANOTHER POST FOR UPDATING FOR SPLITTING ITEMS???
